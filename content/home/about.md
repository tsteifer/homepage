I am currently a postdoc at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile and the <a href="https://imfd.cl/">Instituto Milenio Fundamentos de los datos</a>, where I am supervised by <a href="https://pbarcelo.ing.uc.cl/">Pablo Barceló</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z1aTUGsAAAAJ&hl=es">Cristóbal Rojas</a>.
At the same time I am on the leave from the <a href="https://www.ippt.pan.pl/en/">Institute of Fundamental Technological Research</a> of the <a href="https://institution.pan.pl/">Polish Academy of Sciences</a>.
<br><br>

I have completed my doctoral thesis <i>Computable prediction of infinite binary sequences with zero-one loss</i>, written under the supervision of <a href="https://home.ipipan.waw.pl/l.debowski/">Łukasz Dębowski</a> and <a href="http://dariuszkalocinski.com">Dariusz Kalociński</a>, and defended with distinction at the <a href="https://ipipan.waw.pl/">Institute of Computer Science</a>. I am also a co-investigator at the Polish National Science Center grant <i>Algorithmic models of prediction: formal properties and philosophical implications</i> coordinated by Dariusz Kalociński. 

My recent research is focused on computablity theory and foundations of probability, esp. algorithmic randomness and computable measure theory. More generally, I am interested in using mathematical tools to study epistemological questions, such as, what can be known? How can we learn what is unknown? What are the limits of our cognition? Can we foresee the future? 
I have a strong affinity for <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/meta.12029">mathematical philosophy</a> and I like to think that some of my research is a part of it.</div>

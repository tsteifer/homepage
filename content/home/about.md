I am currently a postdoc at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile and the <a href="https://imfd.cl/">Instituto Milenio Fundamentos de los datos</a>, where I am supervised by <a href="https://pbarcelo.ing.uc.cl/">Pablo Barceló</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z1aTUGsAAAAJ&hl=es">Cristóbal Rojas</a>.
<br><br>
I am on the leave from the <a href="https://www.ippt.pan.pl/en/">Institute of Fundamental Technological Research</a> of the <a href="https://institution.pan.pl/">Polish Academy of Sciences</a>. I am also a co-investigator at the Polish National Science Center grant <i>Algorithmic models of prediction: formal properties and philosophical implications</i> coordinated by Dariusz Kalociński. 
<br><br>

My recent research was in computablity theory and foundations of probability, esp. algorithmic randomness and computable measure theory. More generally, I am interested in using mathematical tools to study epistemological questions, such as, what can be known?
I have a strong affinity for <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/meta.12029">mathematical philosophy</a> and I like to think that some of my research is a part of it.</div>

An up-to-date list of my research papers is mantained at <a href="https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=Sjw4GpgAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a>

My affiliation is with the <a href="https://www.ippt.pan.pl/en/">Institute of Fundamental Technological Research</a> of <a href="https://institution.pan.pl/">Polish Academy of Sciences</a> where I am a member of the Laboratory of Professional Electronics.

I have recently completed my doctoral thesis <i>Computable prediction of infinite binary sequences with zero-one loss</i> under the supervision of <a href="https://home.ipipan.waw.pl/l.debowski/">Łukasz Dębowski</a> and <a href=http:/dariuszkalocinski.com>Dariusz Kalociński</a>. I am also a co-investigator at the Polish National Science Center grant <i>Algorithmic models of prediction: formal properties and philosophical implications</i> managed by Dariusz Kalociński. 

As of late, my attention orbits around computablity theory and foundations of probability, esp. algorithmic randomness theory. I am also continuously interested in things such as signal processing, machine learning, mathematical logic and information theory. 
I have a strong affinity for <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/meta.12029">mathematical philosophy</a> and I like to think that some of my research is a part of it. I also like $\LaTeX$.

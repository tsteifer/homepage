Hello, my name is Tomasz Steifer. I am a mathematician and theoretical computer scientist. My recent attention orbit between computablity theory and foundations of probability, esp. algorithmic randomness theory. I did my doctoral thesis on computable prediction under supervision of Łukasz Dębowski and Dariusz Kalociński.

abstract: The medical management of patients with continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) requires frequent measurement and analysis of various physiological parameters. Among the most important is blood pressure (BP), which cannot be reliably measured by the standard oscillometric method because of an impaired pulsation due to continuous flow. The objective of this work is to show the feasibility of ultrasound-based BP measurement in a portable, easy to use device for patients with LVAD in home-based rehabilitation environments, enabling long-term remote monitoring. We have implemented a BP measurement system which uses continuous wave (CW) Doppler ultrasound for blood flow detection. The system is based on a standard cuff design with custom analog CW circuitry connected to a high-performance, low-power 32-bit microcontroller (ARM Cortex-M7). The uC is responsible for system control, as well as Doppler signal acquisition and processing. A dedicated ultrasound probe equipped with an elastic strap is placed over the radial artery. In the target solution, the cuff pressure and CW signal will be analyzed in real-time to provide systolic and/or mean blood pressure. At present, we have acquired raw signals for off-line analysis. The system was tested in clinical experiments both on healthy patients and patients with three types of commercially available LVADs (HeartWare, HeartMate II and HeartMate III). The observed morphology of Doppler signals in patients with LVADs was much more variable between patients and pumps. In most cases, we were able to estimate the systolic pressure, but the measurement of diastolic pressure was not conclusive. We observed variable blood flow patterns generated by the Lavare cycle (a periodic speed modulation feature of some LVADs), which further complicates the estimation. A prototype of an automatic BP measuring device for patients with rotary LVADs has been demonstrated. In the next step, we are planning an animal validation study with invasive blood pressure monitoring.

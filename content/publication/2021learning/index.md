abstract: Recently, a connection has been established between two branches of computability theory, namely, between algorithmic randomness and algorithmic learning theory.  Learning-theoretical  characterizations  of  several  notions  of  randomness  were  discovered.  We  study  such  characterizations  based  on  the  asymptotic  density  of  positive answers. In particular, this note provides a new learning-theoretic definition of weak 2-randomness, solving the problem posed by (Zaffora Blando, Rev. Symb. Log. 2019). The note also highlights the close connection between these characterizations and the problem of convergence on random sequences.
